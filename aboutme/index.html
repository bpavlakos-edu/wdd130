    <p>Hello everyone! I'm from Washington State, where there's lots of rain, but no snow for some odd reason. I'm currently persuing a degree in applied technology, but my dream is to get a degree in Computer Engineering!</p>
    <p>I've always been the family "tech-support" guy. Even as early as elementary school, I was helping my school teachers with their computer problems. 
        Because of this, I've always been good with technology, and I learned many things about computers. My familiarity with technology would ultimately bring me to my next step in life.</p>
    <p>When I was 12, I began tinkering with the script files one of my favorite video games. Armed with nothing but notepad, and a complete and total disregard for the existence of tab characters, punctuation marks, or really anything that might have possibly prevented those scripts 
    from being destroyed by a 12 year old without error checking software, I began modifying parts of the game and found it quite entertaining (despite the thousands of syntax error warnings I was getting). Little did I know, I was starting on my path towards becoming a Computer Programmer.  
    I didn't know it was programming until I started taking two programming classes in High School, Visual Basic, and Processing. There I recognized "if statements", "Loops", and "Syntax Errors, things I had ran into frequently
    while modifying the script files. It was then that I knew I wanted to become a computer programmer, and I took a Java class later in High School. It's been my go-to programming language to this day!</p>
    <p>Later in my life, my programming skills grew ten-fold as I took on a new hobby: Reverse Engineering. Reverse Engineering is quite simply, taking an exported file or program and decoding every "byte" of it with a hex editor,
        or using a disassembly program, to analyze the assembly code of a published program. The goal of doing this is to understand the every single "byte" of a file format in the hopes of modifying it, such making a map editor program, or importing a 3D model to 3D editing software. 
        Or analyzing the program's functions, and modifying it's assembly code to make it function better than it ever has before (like removing a unit limit from a game from the 2000s)! I really enjoy it, because it's like a giant puzzle to solve, and I always learn something new in the process!</p>
    <p>Fast forward to now, and Reverse Engineering has taught me many things. New programming languages, like C#, and a little bit of assembly. New techniques and tricks people use to save space, and really optimize their programs. I've learned a lot about "data types" what they look like, and how it impacts the size of a file.
        And I've unfortunately learned a lot about some really complicated math, that makes my head hurt sometimes. 
        But the most important lesson I've learned from Reverse Engineering is that with hard work and determination (and a ton of prayer too), nothing is truly impossible! In total, I've been able to decode 11 file formats, and modify 6 game EXEs.</p>
        <p>Some of you might be wondering, if I have all these programming capabilities, surely I've released something to the public. Well I have, but for the sake of protecting my online identity, I'm just going to tell you
            that I've made a very impactful mod for a decently popular AAA game. As of right now it sits at 11671 downloads, and 64025 views. If you want to know the mod and what game it's for, just reply to my post, and I'd be happy to tell you!
        <p>Apart from programming, my other favorite hobby is electrical engineering. I like to take apart and make elecrical circuits, just as much as I like taking apart and creating computer programs! 
            In High School I took an Electrical Engineering class my senior year, and enjoyed every second of it!</p>
        <p>Another very important facet of my life has been my life-long membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I've gained a personal testimony of The Book of Mormon, I know it's true, and I also know that it was made for our day.
            I know Heavenly Father loves each and every one of us, he's shown me that more times than I can count. I also know that we can turn to Heavenly Father for help, with everything. 
            Even for things we think aren't important to Him, like programming projects, he'll help us because of his love for us. I know that Jesus Christ died for every one of us, and that no one is too far away from the reach of the atonement.
            I am greatful that I was able to come to the earth today, to learn of the gospel, the Plan of Salvation, and to grow through the many trials of life.
        </p>
        <p>I have many things I still have to learn, one of them being web design. Even though I've used developer tools and inspect element to view web pages, and make silly edits to them. It's not the familiar structure I'm used to. 
            HTML and CSS are both very robust, and can endure a lot of wacky things, that would make programming languages like Java have a meltdown. But I've learned so much more about HTML and CSS over the past week than I'd ever thought possible!
        I went from not knowing how to change text color in HTML, to making animated gradients and 3D rotations in CSS. Granted I did some extra reading for that, but this class ultimately is what pushed me to learn! I can't wait to see where the rest of the class brings me!
