                    <p>But before we do that, we need to answer a simple question first:</p>

                    <p>Electricity is the energy produced by the movement of electrons. The reason it can be confusing because electrons are invisible, but it's actually not that hard to understand! It's very similar to something we deal with every day: water! Like water flows through pipes, electrons flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. The measurement of the energy produced by this movement is called "power", which is measured in "voltage", and the speed at which the electrons move, or "current" as it's called in electronics, is measured in "amperage".</p>

                    <p>Electrons will literally jump through hoops to get to the negative terminal, so they'll go through anything you put in their path, especially electronic components, like Light Emitting Diodes, light bulbs, resistors, and motors, which are designed to harness the energy electrons produce, to accomplish a specific purpose!</p>
                    <p>Another similarity between electricity and water, is that we can control the speed the electrons flow, and by extension, control the voltage. In electronics, the measurement of this factor is called "resistance" which is measured in "ohms", and each electronic component gives its own amount of "resistance", the one specifically designed for this task is fittingly called a "resistor".</p>

                    <p>Voltage, Resistance, and Current all work together in a predictable fashion. So predictable in fact that it can be mathematically represented by an equation called "Ohm's Law". Which is the following equation:</p>
                    
                    <img src="images/ee_ohms_law.png" class="equation1"alt="Voltage Equals Current Times Resistance">
                    
                    <p>Which we can then use basic algebra, to create the following equations:</p>
                    <div class="groupedImages">

                    </div>
                    <p>Usually, the resistance and voltage are known before you even turn the circuit on. And with these equations, you can predict the current and voltage at specific points.</p>
                    <p>In the following image, voltage is represented by "V", amperage is represented by "A", and Resistance is represented by "&Omega;".</p> 
                    <p>The last value is power, which is called a "watt", it is represented by "W". You can read more about watts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt" target="_blank">here on wikipedia,</a> where it explains that watts are a unit of power, and can be calculated using the equation "Watts = Voltage &times; Amperage". But that's not necessary to understand lesson.</p>

                    <p>Sure, this might be a little difficult to visualize, especially if you don't like math. Luckily, the Falstad circuit simulator has a premade circuit for "ohms law", and it demonstrates the relationship between these values quite well.</p>

                    <p>One thing to note is that unlike water, electrons travel at a uniform speed, so you can slow them down as early or as late in the circuit as you'd like!</p>

                    <p>You can even split electricity across multiple components, at the price of spreading the flow of electrons across multiple places. Surprisingly, this actually preserves the original voltage, and if a component fails electricity will continue to flow through the remaining functional path.</p>
                    <p>The downside? It drains a significant amount of the electrons' energy, so don't plan on using the remaining power for anything useful, unless you want to crank up the input voltage!</p>
                    <p>The other way to arrange electronic circuits is to chain them together end to end. This configuration is called "series" and any change to the flow in the circuit, affects the flow and voltage of the entire circuit!</p>

                    <p>These concepts apply to both electronic components, and power sources.</p>
                    <p>Ever wonder why, you put batteries in a flashlight with the positive end of each battery connecting to the negative end of the next battery? Putting the batteries in series combines their voltage together, producing a greater voltage output than any battery could do on its own.</p> 
                    <p>Even in devices where you put batteries up and down, they're really connected together in series, by thin metal contacts that go across the top and bottom each slot.</p>

                        <p>Any electronic device in your house can operate less batteries than normal, as long as the circuit is bridged by a conductive material.</p>
                        <p>When an electronic device is turned on, with less batteries than normal, by briging the remaining slot with a conductive material, it will do one of 3 things:</p>
                        <li>It won't turn on at all</li>
                        <li>It operating like its on low battery</li> 
                        <li>It could even function normally, but its lights a little dimmer than usual</li>
                        <p>Any of these behaviors are normal, that's because the device is operating on less voltage than what it was originally designed for.</p>
                        <p>The result of this action depends on how the device was designed.</p>
                        <p>Some electronic devices are designed to operate on voltages far below the number of batteries they can fit. Others, are designed for precise amounts of voltage, and their components don't have enough power to operate.</p>
                        <p>While the voltage of a device can be decreased by removing its batteries, the opposite is also true.</p>
                        <p>If more batteries are connected to the device in series, the voltage is increased.</p>
                        <p>This action is exponentially more dangerous than lowering the number of batteries, because the increased voltage and current causes incredible harm to both people and electronic devices! Improper handling of such high voltage and current can easily kill you</p>
                        <p>The following YouTube videos demonstrate what batteries are capable of when you connect absurd numbers of them together in series:</p>
                        <p>I did not produce any of these youtube videos, they are property of the youtube channel owners and can be accessed by the links in the title, or in the embedded player itself</p>
                        <p>These videos do not reflect my opinons on electronic saftey, they simply demonstrate the concept of connecting batteries together in series to increase voltage.</p>

                    <!-- <iframe></iframe> -->
                    <p>This is what's called a "short circuit", and usually it's a bad thing! As you'll learn in future parts of this lesson, certain electronic components require specific voltage, or are designed to receive input on specific pins. Any conditions that cause those electronic components (like LEDs or integrated circuits) to receive inputs beyond their designed capabilities, will result in a damaged or destroyed component!</p>
                    <p>While we're on the subject of water, how does water itself affect an electronic circuit? Tap water is a great conductor, which essentially makes it a big wire connecting literally everything it touches together! As you can imagine, it creates lots of short circuits and damages electronic components with ease! Though there are some circuits out there, which use water to intentionally complete the circuit! A good example of this is a water alarm which uses water as a wire, to connect the battery and alarm together!</p>
                    <p>If you're interested in this subject you can read an article from <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/360301/how-water-damages-electronics/" target="_blank">how to geek here, written by Craig Lloyd</a>, about how the minerals inside water act as conductors, and then even corrode circuit boards after periods of long exposure, it even helped me to better understand how to teach this concept!</p>
                    <p>But that's enough about water. Now you're ready to know the basic components, that bring to life the electronic devices you know and love!</p>

                        <p>There are many electronic components, so it's difficult to memorize them all at once. There are also electrical diagrams, which you're going to need to be able to read. Below are common electronic components, and their representations in electrical diagrams.</p>
                        <p>All electronic component's electrical diagram pictures are all from volume 5 of the e-book on electrical engineering, titled "Lessons In Electric Circuits: Volume V - Reference", created by Tony R. Kuphaldt. "Lessons In Electric Circuits" is a 6-volume ebook series on Electrical Engineering, created and copyrighted by Tony R.

                                    <p>These are represented by straight lines in electrical diagrams. The only complicated part is when they go across each-other!</p>
                                    <p>Electrical diagrams, are unfortunately not unanimous in the representation of this, some may choose to have the wire "bounce" over the wire its crossing, while others may choose to draw straight through it and represent an actual connection with a dot. 
                                    (As is mentioned in <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/Ref/REF_9.html#xtocid102790" target="_blank">"Lessons in Electronics Volume 5 - Electronic Diagrams - Wires and Connections"</a>)</p>
                                    <p>I prefer to "bounce" over wires myself, but that's up to personal preference. However, the industry standard today, is to represent connections with dots, and draw a line straight through to represent passing.</p>

                                    <p>Resistors are components used to create resistance... Yes, that is what they do, as the name suggests.<p>
                                    <p>Essentially, inside of them is a coil of wire, this physical distance is designed to increase the physical distance the electrons have to travel in an attempt to slow them down.<p>
                                    <p>Because of this vital function, there are many different strengths of resistors, the more &Omega; (ohms) a resistor is, the more it can slow electrons down.</p>
                                    <p>Due to there being so many resistor strengths, a band-based color code was developed to make them easier to identify, and it's quite simple. </p>
                                    <p>A resistor's color code is read from left to right, with a gap before the final band.</p>
                                    <p>The first band on a resistor signifies the number of its leading digit, the last band before a gap signifies the number of zeroes. And bands between them represent additional digits in the number.</p>
                                    <p>The final band after the gap represents the "tolerance" of the resistor, or in other words the percentage range of accuracy to the printed number. This means the number that the resistor tells you could be plus or minus the percent specified by the final band.</p>
                                    <p>Now because this is a lot to take in all at once, I'm attaching the color code diagram from the <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/Ref/REF_2.html" target="_blank">restistor color code page of "Lessons In Electric Circuits: Volume V - Reference" By Tony R. Kuphaldt</a>. It even has colored examples of real resistors, that will help you understand the concept better, so please visit the page to learn more about resistors.</p>

                                    <p>A light emitting diode is a one-way component that produces light using electricity.</p>
                                    <p>They weren't as common in the beginning of electronics, but as electronic circuits have become smaller, they have become easier to produce and more powerful, all while using less energy.</p>
                                    <p>Today they have virtually erased the need for traditional light bulbs in most devices, the traditional lamp-based flashlights of yesterday cannot compete with the LED arrays put in todays flashlights.</p>
                                    <p>A typical LED consists of two metal contacts, an anode and a cathode. The anode must be connected to a positive voltage source, while the cathode must be connected to a place in the circuit where the electrons can reach the negative or ground terminal. Otherwise the electrons cannot get across.</p>
                                    <p>This "one way" behavior is shared with diodes, which also have anodes and cathodes. Hence the name of this device is "Light Emitting Diode"</p>
                                    <p>Unlike wires or switches, LEDs are designed to operate at very narrow range of voltages and currents, most operate at around 3v and below, but it depends on what their "specfications" are. Specifications are usally shown in the product listing, or datasheet that the manufacturer provides online or comes the item itself.</p>
                                    <p>Any higher voltage or current than the manufacture specifications say it can handle, and it will be instantly destroyed.</p>
                                    <p>Because of this, LEDs are typically paired with a limiting resistor, to limit both the voltage and the current. When I use a 3v LED in a 5v circuit (which is a voltage that is quite common to work with), I pair it with a 200&Omega;(Ohm) or greater resistor to prevent it from getting destroyed.</p>
