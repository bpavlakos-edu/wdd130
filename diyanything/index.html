                <h2>Ready to learn something new?</h2>
                <p>Here, I will teach you 3 lessons about my hobbies; Computer Programming, Electrical Engineering, and Reverse Engineering, in an intentional order, so that each lesson will help you understand the next.
                    <br><br>In the first lesson, I'll teach you the very basics of computer programming, in a language designed for beginners, but robust enough, to prepare you for learning more programming languages in the future.
                    <br><br>In the second lesson, I will teach you the basics of electrical engineering, so that you can take your code and use it to impact the physical world. 
                    <br><br>In the final lesson, you'll learn basics of reverse engineering, so that you can understand how a computer thinks. By learning how a computer thinks, you'll understand how to decode programs and unknown file formats. I will also teach you how to formulate a plan, to modify finished binaries, so that limitations (or errors), in programs that have no hope of being updated, can be removed.
                    <br><br>I will also give you links to every tool and tutorial source I know of, in the “Toolbox” page. All of these “tools” are free or near-free, and many of them will not be related to the lessons at all. This is intentional, I not only want to give you the tools to do my hobbies for free, I want to give you every tool I know of, in the hopes of helping you with your hobbies!
                    <br><br>I promise that no matter who you are, or what your interest-level in the topics is, you will walk away from this website with something new!

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Bryce Pavlakos. My journey with computers started when I was 12, I used notepad to modify a video game's scripts, in a language that to this day, has not been documented online. 
                    <br><br>In High School, I took programming classes, and discovered three things: what I did at age 12 was called “programming”, you can get paid to program, and that programming is easier in languages with online documentation, using programs that tell you when a semicolon is missing. 
                    <br><br>Also in High School, I had the chance to take a class in my other hobby, Electrical Engineering, and I enjoyed it just as much as my programming classes. 
                    <br><br>The hobbies I have and skills I accquired prepared me for the next step in understanding computers, Reverse Engineering!
                    <br><br>Now let me clarify, by “Reverse Engineering” I mean: making programs function better than ever was originally intended, overriding hard-coded EXE limitations in programs that have no hope of ever being updated, and documenting unknown file formats so that a program can be created for mod making. These modifications, are what many people online call “impossible”, but I've learned that many of these “impossible” changes are often only a few bytes away. 
                    <br><br>In my time Reverse Engineering, I've fully reverse-engineered 10+ file formats, across 8+ Video Games, and successfully modified the binaries of 6 Video Games, to make them function better or overcome a limitation. 
                    <br><br>My experiences in mod making and reverse engineering, have taught me more about the inner workings of computers than anyone would want to willingly learn, and introduced me to powerful tools, many of which being free. It has also taught me, that nothing is truly impossible if you set your mind to it. It can be very difficult at times, but in the end overcoming a challenge is always worth the effort!</p>
