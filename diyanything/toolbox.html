                            <p>I learned it in high school, and the things I learned in it I still use today!</p>
                            <p>The best part about it, is not only that it's simple to use, but it's also free.</p>
                            <p>There are several other versions of it too, designed to use different langauges too like Python! But the Java Version, which is also the main version is the one I'm most familiar with!</p>

                            <p>Even if it doesn't support the langauge you're using (like some of the modding langauges I have), you can still use it to have access to it's amazing features, like <a>multi-line cursors</a>, multiple workspaces, quick navigation, and live sharing over the internet!</p>

                            <p>Do you wish there was a version of notepad designed for coding? Well, here's your dream come true!</p>
                            <p>Notepad++ is a text editor designed for coding, it has the ability to search across files, collapse code blocks, and has autocompletion!</p>
                            <p>It supports many langauges immediately. But one of it's most powerful features, is the ability to create "user-defined langauges" or UDLs for short. UDLs let you define the syntax for a specific file type, allowing you to take full advantage of the features recognzied languages have. It's really great for obscure or undocumented scripting languages!</p>
                            <p>Notepad++ also has extensions, allowing for even further customization!</p>

                            <p>Created by the National Security Agency, Ghidra is a dissasembly tool that was released to the public in 2017. In other words, it is software that can analyze an exe and turn it into somewhat comprehendable code.</p>
                            <p>It is completely free, open source, community-driven, cutsomizable, and extremely powerful. And the feature list will only grow as time goes on!</p>
                            <p>I've used this program to help me reverse engineer many games and software, by labeling unknown functions, and taking advantage of ghidra's features (like string tables, hex search, and tree view). And it has taught me how to look at assembly and see how it translates into code!</p>
                            <p>The only real catch here, is that you need to have a few gigabytes of space to store the ghidra projects! Though, in my entire time reverse engineering a grand total of about 28 different programs I've only used up 2.3gb.</p>
                            <p>You can download it, and it's source code <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank">on their page here</a> or directly on their <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra" target="_blank">github page here</a>.</p>

                            <h2>Cheat Engine</h2>
                            <p>Cheat engine is a tool, not "hacking" software. Essentially it's a live memory scanner that allows you to search for and edit hexadecimal values in memory, and find (and change or disable) assembly code (hexadecimal computer code) of programs that are running on your computer.</p>
                            <p>It also has a variety of features to make reverse engineering easy, such as being able to automatically detect the exact opcodes that change the value of memory you've scanne, and being able to browse the application's memory in both hex view and assembly code view.</p>
                            <p>Despite these amazing features, and being an irreplaceable tool in my reverse engineering toolkit for testing exe assembly code modifications quickly, it's become increasingly difficult to download this software without running the risk of getting a virus, and really the only options are to pay for it on the patreon, compile it yourself from it's github page (DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE PUBLISHED EXE THERE EITHER IT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM).</p>
                            <p>Download Link Coming as soon as I can find a way to give it to you without "optional" virus ads in the installer!</p>
                            <p><b>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DOWNLOAD CHEAT ENGINE ON YOUR OWN UNLESS YOU ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE RISK OF VIRUSES CAUSED BY ADS IN THE INSTALLER (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_Engine#Malware_distribution">read this part of it's wikipedia article to know what I'm talking about</a>) AND THE FACT THAT SOME ONLINE-FOCUSED VIDEO GAMES ACTIVELY CHECK FOR INSTALLATIONS OF CHEAT ENGINE ON YOUR COMPUTER AND BAN YOU IF IT'S DETECTED!!!</b></p>
                            <p>If you do have cheat engine installed, please, only use it for debugging, learning, and reverse engineering. Not for harassing people in online games with scripts you bought online for exorberant prices, no one likes that or thinks it's impressive.</p>
                            <p>So in summary, cheat engine is a difficult to accquire tool, that can be used for good (improving software for everyone) or for evil (ruining online games and getting banned), so please don't waste your time using it for evil, use it to learn, and improve the lives of others instead.</p>

                            <p>The hero photos for each lesson page, was created using gimp, it's filters, and the fractal explorer.</p>

Suprisingly, I found it quite difficult to find something Windows 10 can do that Unbutu can't do. Most of the software on this page can be installed on Linux, and by extension Unbutu!</p>
                            <p>You can download it <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">on their page here</a></p>
                            <p>Though I will mention that <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a> is an alternative that's even closer to Windows, neat!</p>

                            <p>There are 1206 different characters on the <a href="https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters" target="_blank">MUGEN wiki alone</a>, and there are definitely more websites to get things from too!</p>
                            <p>But that's not the end of it, you can download <a href="https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Stages" target="_blank">stages</a>, <a href="https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Motifs" target="_blank">new interfaces</a>, and even <a href="https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Full_Games">entire MUGEN packages</a>.

                            <p>Also you can make your own chacters using <a href="https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/Fighter_Factory" target="_blank">Fighter Factory</a>, and add your newly downloaded characters easily with <a href="https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/VSelect" target="_blank">VSelect</a></p>
