      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our purpose is to teach the audience as much about my hobbies as possible, in a way they'll remember. We will achieve this goal through eye-catching CSS, interactive graphics (like image maps or interactive text highlighting), and ensuring that the content we teach is simple enough for beginners, and still useful to those who already have experience. We will also be providing links to the many, low cost or free, tools and tutorials, that I use each day to accomplish my goals, even ones that aren't directly related to content of the website. All this will be done, in the hope that the audience will not only learn how to do my hobbies, but also be inspired to overcome the challenges in their own.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target audience is anyone who is willing to learn something new, especially those who want to learn more about my technology-related hobbies, we'll try to appeal to them visually, because if they see something awesome, they'll try to figure out how it works, and learn from it. Another important target audience, are those who's hobbies are hindered by seemingly impossible challenges. The experiences and the resources I provide are here to both inspire, and directly assist them so they can overcome their challenges. Many of the free tools and tutorials I use on a daily basis, have been around for years, I've simply just never known about them before now. Other tools, are brand new, but also obscure, making them difficult to locate unless you stumble upon them by chance. I'm confident that anyone who visits my website will learn gain something, whether that's a tool, a new way of thinking, or even just the idea to look for resources they haven't utilized yet.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        My name is Bryce Pavlakos. My journey with computers started when I was 12, I used notepad to modify a video game's scripts, in a language that to this day, has not been documented online. In High School, I took programming classes, and discovered three things: what I did at age 12 was called “programming”, you can get paid to program, and that programming is easier in languages with online documentation, using programs that tell you when a semicolon is missing. In High School, I also had the chance to take a class in my other hobby, Electrical Engineering, and I enjoyed it just as much as my programming classes. The hobbies and skills prepared me for the next step in understanding computers, Reverse Engineering! Now let me clarify, by “Reverse Engineering” I mean: making programs function better than ever was originally intended, overriding hard-coded EXE limitations in programs that have no hope of ever being updated, and documenting unknown file formats so that a program can be created for mod making. These modifications, are what many people online call “impossible”, but I've learned that many of these “impossible” changes are often only a few bytes away. In my time Reverse Engineering, I've fully reverse-engineered 10+ file formats, across 8+ Video Games, and successfully modified the binaries of 6 Video Games, to make them function better or overcome a limitation. My experiences in mod making and reverse engineering, have taught me more about the inner workings of computers than anyone would want to willingly learn, and introduced me to powerful tools, many of which being free. It has also taught me, that nothing is truly impossible if you set your mind to it. It can be very difficult at times, but in the end overcoming a challenge is always worth the effort!
        <br>
        On this site, I will teach you 3 lessons about my hobbies (Computer Programming, Electrical Engineering, and Reverse Engineering) in a specific order, so that each lesson can build off the other one. First, I'll teach you the very basics of computer programming. After that, I will then teach you the basics of electrical engineering, so that you can take your code and use it to impact the physical world. And finally, after learning how programming and electricity work together, I'll then teach you the basics of reverse engineering, so that you can understand how a computer thinks, and in turn understand how to decode unknown file formats. I will also teach you how to formulate a plan, to modify finished binaries, so that limitations (or errors), in programs that have no hope of being updated, can be removed. On this website, I will also give you links, to every tool and tutorial source I know of, in the “Toolbox” page. All of these “tools” are free or near-free, and many of them will not be related to the lessons at all. This is intentional, I not only want to give you the tools to do my hobbies for free, I want to give every tool I know of, in the hopes of helping you with your hobbies. I promise you, that no matter who you are, or what your interest-level in my hobbies is, you can walk away from this website with something new!

      <h3>Reverse Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        During the lesson on programming, we learned that computers will do anything we tell them to do. We can even tell computers to turn a light on and off, with a high and low voltage. But how do computers store numbers and pictures? How does it know to say “Hello world!” when we tell it “print(“Hello World!”);”? Well, the answer is quite simple, all data in computers is stored in two ways: 1 and 0. 
        These two numbers represent the voltage a basic CPU receives at it's input wire (known as the input pin), 1 for voltage, 0 for no voltage. On or off. This 0 or 1 value is called a “bit”. Bits can be used to represent many things, primarily “True” which is represented by 1, or “False”, which is represented by 0. Or it could represent the numbers 1 and 0. 

        This is great, but the immediate problem occurs, when you you want to store the number 2. Do you simply add two bits of “1” together to make two? That could work, but what if you wanted to add 1 to 1? You'd need 100 bits set to 1 to do it, which means that a basic CPU would have to check it's input pin 100 times just to do simple addition! 

        So how do computers do these incredible calculations so fast?  Instead of testing the value of 1 reading from the input pin, a basic CPU can instead, check it's input pin 8 times, reading 8 bits, to represent an “8-bit integer”, which means a whole number (integer) stored in 8 bits. But how can we store 100 in 8 1's and 0's? The answer: Math! But don't panic, it's really quite simple!

        In an 8-bit integer, there are two things that determine the value of the number: how many 1's and 0's it has, and the position of the 1's and 0's. The position of the 1's and 0's in the group of 8, determines it's value, simply by representing it as 2 to the power of it's position from right to left, starting at 0. It is then added together with it's neighbors, to get the final value. The 0 and the 1 determine if the position should be included in the calculation. So instead of representing 2 as “1 1”, we can represent it as “0 0 1 0” or “(2^1 * 1) + (2^0 * 0)” or even simply: “2 + 0”. [Text continues to explain 99 in binary]

      <h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        In the lesson on computer programming, you learned how to tell a computer what to do. But now, you will learn how to tell electricity what to do, which will allow you to make computer programs that interact with the world around you!

        But before we do that we have to start simple

        Electricity, is often confusing because it's invisible. But it's actually not that hard to understand! It's quite similar to something we deal with every day, water! Electricity is the energy produced by the movement of electrons, Like water flows through pipes, electrons flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal (actually, electrons go from negative to positive, but we didn't know that when we invented electrical diagrams, so it's easier to understand it the way I'm teaching you).

        Electrons will literally jump through hoops to get to the negative terminal, so they'll go through anything you put in their path, especially electronic components, like Light Emitting Diodes, light bulbs, resistors, and motors, which are designed to harness the energy electrons produce, to accomplish a specific purpose!

        [Continue to talk about how like water, electrons take the path of least resistance, and produce short circuits]

        [Walk through a simple circuit, explaining what a diode and resistor is]

        [Swap it for a switch]

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>
      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The home page is where I introduce the lesson topics. <br><br> The header will use CSS to animate a set of DIVs circles inside a grid layout, (similar to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/fun-times-css-pixel-art/" target="_blank">this article I found on CSS-tricks</a>, after I had already come up with the idea). I will use a python script to rapidly generate the necessary HTML and CSS code, or javascript to generate the html elements in the site itself.
      </p>
      <img src="images/hp_page_plan.png" alt="Home Page Wireframe">

      <h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
      <p>         
        This page is a lesson page, it's the second lesson of the three. We will be embedding the <a href="https://falstad.com/circuit/" target="_blank">falstad.com circuit simulator</a> to the page, to practice making electrical circuits. We will also walk through making a circuit using an arduino in <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits">TinkerCad</a>, which allows you to simulate many circuits without having to buy anything.
      </p>
      <img src="images/ee_page_plan.png" alt="Electrical Engineering Page Wireframe">

      <h3>Reverse Engineering</h3>
      <p>         
        This page is a lesson page, it's the final lesson on the website. During this lesson I will teach the user about Binary, Hexadecimal, Common Hexadecimal Values, File Formats, Hex Editors, Cheat Engine (which is a tool for hex editing programs in real time), Assembly and Ghidra (a free open-source disassembly tool made and released by the NSA).
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, Cheat Engine has recently become no longer safe to download, because it's installer has Adware that is practically forced, when it previously was able to be skipped. I'll give the user the old version of cheat engine I use (7.0), in a 7z file so they aren't put in danger. I will also give a link to the offical cheat engine github (it's open source), to compile the latest version (7.4) themselves if they want the newest features.
      </p>
      <img src="images/re_page_plan.png" alt="Reverse Engineering Page Wireframe">
      <h3>Programming Page</h3>
      <p>         
        The Computer Programming Page will be just like the reverse engineering and electrical engineering page, it will be a "lesson" page, and sequentially it will be the first Lesson Page if the user were to go in order. We will use the <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing Programming Language</a> to make simple programs, and secretly have the user practice for the programming needed in the electrical engineering lesson. At the end I'll give them lots of good coding langauges to try next, and IDEs (like VSCode, Visual Studio, and IntelliJ) that they can use to make their own programs.
      </p>
      <img src="#" alt="Programming Page Wireframe [Coming soon!]">

      <h3>Toolbox Page</h3>
      <p>         
        The toolbox page will contain a flex grid image gallery, of download links to various free or near free tools, like Audacity, Gimp, Inkscape, Blender, Godot, and Davinci Resolve. They will be organzied by topic, and the topics are indicated by H1 elements. There will also be links or embedded tutorials I've found useful on various topics, many of them being related to the software I mentioned here. This page will contain every program used in the tutorials, but many of the tools I provide here will not be related to the lessons, but they will be very useful. Each "card" will have a short description and push button, sending you to the download link. Cheat Engine will have a warning on this page too.
