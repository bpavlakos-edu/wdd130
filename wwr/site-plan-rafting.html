    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose is to make white water rafting available to everyone and every budget. 
    Every day white water rafting companies don't meet the needs of customers who, for a reduced cost, would enjoy the experience of white water rafting. 
    We want to deliver quality service to these people, and provide an experience that will make them want to ride with us again!
    If we provide them quality service, these customers will then tell others about us, others who like the idea of spending less for better service.
    In summary, we deliver quality service for a lower price than everyone else, so that we gain more customers, and ultimately more revenue.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target audience is a very wide net. We will be targeting people of all ages and genders, but mostly those who like the outdoors and white water rafting.
    What makes us different is that we will be specifically targeting people who like to save money and people who can't afford white water rafting normally.
    These customers really only have two choices, ride with us, or don't ride at all, and if we deliver quality service, they'll tell others (who normally spend more), that they can get better service for a lower cost. 
    Our customers will reach our website through many means, but because they are very careful with their finances, 
    they'll likely be using older technology. This means we have to optimize our website so it loads quickly on older devices.

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/0695ea-1e0c6f-f67a14-ffffff"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/0695ea-1e0c6f-f67a14-ffffff</a>

      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
